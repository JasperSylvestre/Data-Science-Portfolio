## About Me
I am Jasper Sylvestre, an NCSU alumni with a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics, an aspiring data scientist, and current software developer working with training LLMs. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and AI with regards to data science. I hope to enter graduate school with a focus on data science, applied statistics, and machine learning in the coming semester or maybe next year. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science.

## Project: Road Accident Analysis - EDA
This Jupyter notebook explores road accident data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. This data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farshidbahrami021/road-accident-dataset) and is in the data folder. For detailed insights through EDA, refer to the notebooks folder. For visualizations, refer to the image folder.

Note that this data was randomly generated and is purely for learning purposes, but we will treat it here as a real-world data set.
