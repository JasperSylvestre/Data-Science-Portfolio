## About Me

Hi, I’m Jasper Sylvestre, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) at UNC Chapel Hill. I completed my undergraduate studies at North Carolina State University, where I earned a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics. As an aspiring data scientist, I’m currently working as a software developer, focusing on training large language models (LLMs). My passion lies in data science, particularly machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.

Looking ahead, I plan to graduate in December 2025 from the MADS program, with a keen interest in data science, applied statistics, and machine learning. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science described below.

## Project: Road Accident Analysis - EDA

The notebook can be examined online for full feature access on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JasperSylvestre/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/road-accidents-eda/notebooks/road-accident-eda-notebook.ipynb).

This Jupyter Notebook explores road accident data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. This data set can be found on Kaggle. This analysis demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and thoughtful model approaches in extracting insights from complex data sets. Further research, model exploration, and analysis could lead to valuable insights about this data, potentially for reducing road accident deaths, improving road safety measures, and improving road design.

Note that this data was randomly generated and is purely for learning purposes, but we will treat it here as a real-world data set.
