## About Me

I am Jasper Sylvestre, a North Carolina State University alumni who graduated in Winter 2023 with a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics, an aspiring data scientist, and current software developer working with training LLMs. I am passionate about data science and especially machine learning, deep learning, and AI. I wish to enter graduate school focusing on data science, applied statistics, and machine learning in the Fall, 2024 semester. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science described below.

## Project: Road Accident Analysis - EDA

The notebook can be examined online for full feature access on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JasperSylvestre/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/road-accidents-eda/notebooks/road-accident-eda-notebook.ipynb).

This Jupyter Notebook explores road accident data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. This data set can be found on Kaggle. This analysis demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and thoughtful model approaches in extracting insights from complex data sets. Further research, model exploration, and analysis could lead to valuable insights about this data, potentially for reducing road accident deaths, improving road safety measures, and improving road design.

Note that this data was randomly generated and is purely for learning purposes, but we will treat it here as a real-world data set.
