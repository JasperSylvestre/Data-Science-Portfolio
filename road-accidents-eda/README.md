## About Me

I am Jasper Sylvestre, an NCSU alumni with a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics, an aspiring data scientist, and current software developer working with training LLMs. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and AI with regards to data science. I hope to enter graduate school with a focus on data science, applied statistics, and machine learning in the coming semester or maybe next year. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science.

## Project: Road Accident Analysis - EDA

The notebook can be examined online for full feature access on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JasperSylvestre/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/road-accidents-eda/notebooks/road-accident-eda-notebook.ipynb).

This Jupyter notebook explores road accident data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. This data set can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farshidbahrami021/road-accident-dataset). This analysis demonstrates the importance of data preproccessing, explorary data analysis, and thoughtful model approaches in extracting insights from complex data sets. Further research, model exploration, and analysis could lead to valuable insights about this data, potentially for reducing road accident death, improving road safety measures, and improving road design

Note that this data was randomly generated and is purely for learning purposes, but we will treat it here as a real-world data set.
