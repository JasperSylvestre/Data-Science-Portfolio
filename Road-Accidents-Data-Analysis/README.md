# Road Accidents Data Analysis

## About Me
I am Jasper Sylvestre, an NCSU alumni with a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics, an aspiring data scientist, and current software developer working with training LLMs. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and AI with regards to data science. I hope to enter graduate school with a focus on data science, applied statistics, and machine learning in the coming semester or maybe next year. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science.

## Project: Road Accident Analysis - EDA and Data Cleaning
This Jupyter notebook explores road accident data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. This data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farshidbahrami021/road-accident-dataset). For detailed insights trough EDA and cleaning procedures, refer to the notebook titled "Road_Accident_Data_Analysis_EDA_Cleaning.ipynb". Note that this data was randomly generated and is purely for learning purposes.
