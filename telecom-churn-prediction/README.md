## About Me

I am Jasper Sylvestre, an NCSU alumni with a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics, an aspiring data scientist, and current software developer working with training LLMs. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and AI with regards to data science. I hope to enter graduate school with a focus on data science, applied statistics, and machine learning in the coming semester or maybe next year. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science.

## Project: Telecom Churn Prediction

Examine the notebook online for full feature access on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JasperSylvestre/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/telecom-churn-prediction/notebooks/telecom-churn-prediction-notebook.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive approach to predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Key steps include data import and initial inspection, data cleaning, data preprocessing, model training with cross-validation, evaluation on testing data, and discussion on further model improvement strategies.
