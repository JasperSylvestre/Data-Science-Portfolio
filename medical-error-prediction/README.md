## About Me
I am Jasper Sylvestre, an NCSU alumni with a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics, an aspiring data scientist, and current software developer working with training LLMs. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and AI with regards to data science. I hope to enter graduate school with a focus on data science, applied statistics, and machine learning in the coming semester or maybe next year. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science.

## Project: Medical Error Prediction
This project aims to predict broad categories of medical errors using machine learning techniques, specifically employing Random Forest classification and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). It is a refinement of a project previously conducted at North Carolina State University (NCSU) for ST 495 instructed by Srijan Sengupta during the Fall of 2023. The original project was a collaborative effort with team members: myself, Laylani Callaway, Casey Devine, Tyler March, and Lucy Liu.

## Data Confidentiality

The data used in this project is confidential and cannot be shared. The data folder contains a CSV file with only the column names for reference.

## Files and Folders

* `data/`: Contains the CSV file with column names.
* `scripts/`: The R script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* `results/`: Saved results of the models.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to my former teammates Laylani Callaway, Casey Devine, Tyler March, and Lucy Liu for their contributions during the original project at NCSU for ST 495. Additionally, gratitude is extended to the instructor of ST 495, Srijan Sengupta, for his guidance and support throughout the project. Finally, special thanks to Ed Kline for his invaluable assistance in providing the data, explaining its intricacies, and patiently addressing any questions or concerns we had throughout the course of this project.
