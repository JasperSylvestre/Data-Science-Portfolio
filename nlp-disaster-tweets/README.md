## About Me
I am Jasper Sylvestre, an NCSU alumni with a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics, an aspiring data scientist, and current software developer working with training LLMs. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and AI with regards to data science. I hope to enter graduate school with a focus on data science, applied statistics, and machine learning in the coming semester or maybe next year. This repository showcases a project with analysis related to data science.

## Project: NLP Disaster Tweets
This Jupyter notebook showcases NLP and modeling BiLSTM architecture using the data available on __[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data)__ and is in the data folder. For detailed insights through of the data preprocessing and modeling process, refer to the notebooks folder. For visualizations, refer to the image folder.

The final submission CSV file may be slightly influenced by randomness when running the notebook on your own machine, but using  the current saved file in this repository will yield an F1 score of 0.79037. Significantly improved results can be achieved to get a score of 80 to 85%, especially when employing transfer models like BERT.
